# beanstalk

A native clojure [beanstalkd](http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/) client library. 
Some inspiration and ideas were taken from [cl-beanstalk](https://github.com/antifuchs/cl-beanstalk/).

WARNING: Interface subject to change. This interface is not considered
idiomatic clojure. A more "clojure" interface would probably look something
like the following:

    (beanstalk/with-server config-map
        (use "my-tube")
        (put 0 0 0 5 "hello"))

    (beanstalk/with-server config-map
        (watch "my-tube")
        (let [job (reserve)]
            (do-something-with-job)))

See also [Ã€ la carte configuration in Clojure APIs](http://cemerick.com/2011/10/17/a-la-carte-configuration-in-clojure-apis/).

## Usage

The beanstalk client uses deftype and a protocol declaration to create a simple 
(socket, reader, writer) tuple. The protocol defines methods that are direct 
mappings to the [beanstalk protocol commands](https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt). 
For example: 

    (:use com.github.drsnyder.beanstalk)

    ; producer
    user=> (def b (new-beanstalk))
    user=> (.use b "my-tube")
    user=> (.put b 0 0 0 5 "hello")
    ...
    ; consumer
    user=> (def b (new-beanstalk))
    user=> (.watch b "my-tube")
    user=> (def job (.reserve b)) ; id is (:id job), payload is (:payload job)

This library is also available on [clojars](https://clojars.org/com.github.drsnyder/beanstalk). 
To use, add [com.github.drsnyder/beanstalk "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"] to your dependencies.

## Examples

Two examples are provided:

    ; start consumer
    lein run -m com.github.drsnyder.beanstalk.examples.consumer 

    ; send some data
    lein run -m com.github.drsnyder.beanstalk.examples.producer -m "hello" -n 5 
    ; send shutdown
    lein run -m com.github.drsnyder.beanstalk.examples.producer -m "exit"
